This Java program generates and solves a maze using a randomized algorithm and the A* pathfinding algorithm. The maze is visualized in the console. (walls in maze are X, correct path is O)

Features
Generates a maze of given dimensions.
Uses a randomized algorithm to ensure variety in maze generation.
Solves the maze using the A* pathfinding algorithm.
Visualizes the maze and the solution in the console. (walls in maze are X, correct path is O)
